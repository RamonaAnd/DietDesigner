                        In order to build muscle mass, you need a positive calorie balance i.e. you need to consume more than you burn.
                        For every pound (450g) of muscle you want to build, you'll need to take in around 2,800 calories.
                        This is mostly to support your increased protein turnover, which is likely to be elevated with training
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At most, your body can add around 227 (half a pound) of muscle mass every week.
                        Consequently, if you consume a lot of additional calories while trying to build muscle,
                        you are likely to gain excess fat as well. A daily increase of 250 to 500 calories is recommended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try to stay on the lower end of the range if you gain fat easily, and aim for the higher end of the range if you
                        find it difficult to gain weight overall. Finding the right amount of extra calories to build muscle and stay lean
                        will take some trial and error.

                    <p>
                        Moreover, research suggests that eating lean protein 15 to 20 minutes before, during, and within one hour of
                        working out may help increase muscle mass. While you are unlikely to eat steaks or chicken breasts at the gym,
                        a protein drink or supplement may be beneficial before, during, or after workouts.

                        It's not all about protein, though. To build muscle, lose fat, and get stronger, a healthy, balanced diet should
                        provide you with many meals that meet your caloric expenditures and provide you with nutrition. Here are eight great
                        ideas to help you build muscle mass.
