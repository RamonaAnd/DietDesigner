                        <div>1. The Mediterranean diet</div>
                    </h2>
                    <p>The Mediterranean diet has long been considered the gold standard for nutrition, disease prevention,
                        wellness, and
                        longevity. This is based on its nutrition benefits and sustainability.</p>
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece have
                        traditionally eaten. It is rich in: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>vegetables</li>
                        <li>fruits</li>
                        <li>whole grains</li>
                        <li>fish</li>
                        <li>nuts</li>
                        <li>lentils</li>
                        <li>olive oil</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy products are to be eaten in moderation, and red meats are limited.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, the Mediterranean diet limits: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>refined grains</li>
                        <li>trans fats</li>
                        <li>processed meats</li>
                        <li>added sugar</li>
                        <li>other highly processed foods</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Health benefits</h3>
                    <p>This diet's emphasis on minimally processed foods and plants has been associated with a reduced risk of
                        multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Studies also show that the Mediterranean diet
                        has a preventive effect against certain cancers</p>
                    <p>Though the diet was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that its plant-based,
                        high unsaturated fat dietary pattern can also aid in weight loss</p>
                    <p>A systematic review analyzing five different studies found that, compared with a low fat diet, the
                        Mediterranean diet resulted in greater weight loss after 1 year. Compared with a low carb diet, it
                        produced similar weight loss results</p>
                    <p>One study in more than 500 adults over 12 months found that higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was
                        associated with double the likelihood of weight loss maintenance</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the Mediterranean diet encourages eating plenty of antioxidant-rich foods, which may help
                        combat inflammation and oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals
                    </p>
                    <h3>Other benefits</h3>
                    <p>Recent studies have also found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with decreased risk of mental
                        disorders, including cognitive decline and depression.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eating less meat is also associated with a more sustainable diet for the planet.</p>
                    <h3>Downsides</h3>
                    <p>Since the Mediterranean diet does not put a big emphasis on dairy products, it's important to make sure
                        you still get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet.</p>
                    <strong>Summary</strong>
                    <p>The Mediterranean diet emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, fish, and healthy oils while
                        restricting refined and highly processed foods. </p>
                    <p>While it's not a weight loss diet, studies show that it can promote weight loss and overall health.
