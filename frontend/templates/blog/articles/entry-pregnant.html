            <p>Food is an important factor in maintaining a healthy pregnancy.
                During this time, a woman's nutritional needs increase
                to support the growth and development of her baby.
                It is important for expectant mothers to pay close attention
                to their diet and make sure they are getting
                the necessary nutrients to support a healthy pregnancy..
            </p>

            <p>Here are a few key points to consider when it comes to food during pregnancy:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods: It is important to get a
                        range of nutrients from different sources, so try to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and
                        protein sources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get enough folic acid: Folic acid is an important nutrient for fetal development, and it is recommended
                that pregnant women get at least 400 micrograms per day. Good sources of folic acid include leafy green
                vegetables, citrus fruits, beans, and fortified cereals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoid certain foods: There are some foods that should be avoided during pregnancy, as they may pose a
                        risk to the baby. These include raw or undercooked meats, fish that may contain high levels of mercury, and
                        certain types of soft cheeses.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consult with a healthcare provider: It is always a good idea to discuss dietary needs and concerns with
                        a healthcare provider during pregnancy. They can provide personalized guidance and recommendations based on
                        the specific needs of the mother and baby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods: It is important to get a
                        range of nutrients from different sources, so try to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and
                        protein sources.
                    </li>
                Overall, it is important to pay close attention to nutrition during pregnancy and make sure to get the
                necessary nutrients to support a healthy pregnancy. By following these guidelines and consulting with a
                healthcare provider, expectant mothers can help ensure the best possible outcome for both themselves and
                their baby.</p>
