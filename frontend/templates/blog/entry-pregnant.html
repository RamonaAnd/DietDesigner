      <p>Food is an important factor in maintaining a healthy pregnancy.
         During this time, a woman's nutritional needs increase 
         to support the growth and development of her baby. 
         It is important for expectant mothers to pay close attention 
         to their diet and make sure they are getting
         the necessary nutrients to support a healthy pregnancy..</p>
      <img src="images/pregnant.jpg" alt="Description of image">
      <p>Here are a few key points to consider when it comes to food during pregnancy:

       1.) Eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods: It is important to get a 
        range of nutrients from different sources, so try to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein sources.
        
       2.) Get enough folic acid: Folic acid is an important nutrient for fetal development, and it is recommended that pregnant women get at least 400 micrograms per day. Good sources of folic acid include leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, beans, and fortified cereals.
        
       3.)  Avoid certain foods: There are some foods that should be avoided during pregnancy, as they may pose a risk to the baby. These include raw or undercooked meats, fish that may contain high levels of mercury, and certain types of soft cheeses.
        
       4.)  Stay hydrated: It is important to drink plenty of fluids during pregnancy, as hydration is important for both the mother and the baby. Water is the best choice, but other beverages such as milk and fruit juice can also be included in the diet.
        
       5.)  Consult with a healthcare provider: It is always a good idea to discuss dietary needs and concerns with a healthcare provider during pregnancy. They can provide personalized guidance and recommendations based on the specific needs of the mother and baby.
        
       Overall, it is important to pay close attention to nutrition during pregnancy and make sure to get the necessary nutrients to support a healthy pregnancy. By following these guidelines and consulting with a healthcare provider, expectant mothers can help ensure the best possible outcome for both themselves and their baby.</p>
